# Terminal 3D Renderer (Typescript)

## What is this and why
This is a very SIMPLE and BAREBONES 3D renderer that runs in the terminal. It can display 3 different 3d shapes, being the first three of the five Platonic Solids. A tetrahedron, a cube (and rectangular prism), and an octahedron.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun main.ts
```
# Some videos of the first 3 solids
The other 3 solids do work, and the way the code is now will display and spin an icosahedron. The last solid is the regular dodecahedron.
